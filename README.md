The purpose of StackAssembly is to serve as a foundation for my personal research into programming language design and development. Even though I want it to be complete enough for real code too, that is not its main purpose. Don't expect that it'll work for whatever project you might have in mind.

## Status

I finished the initial design and am currently preparing to start implementing the first version.
