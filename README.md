# StackAssembly

## About

StackAssembly is a minimalist, stack-based, assembly-like programming language.

```
1 2 +
```

It serves as a foundation for my personal research into programming language design and development. Even though I want it to be complete enough for real code too, that is not its main purpose. Don't expect that it will work for whatever project you might have in mind.

## Status

I'm currently implementing the initial design and have not released a first version yet.

## Documentation

Currently, [the initial design document][design] is the best source of documentation that is available for the language overall.
